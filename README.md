# 🎓 Student Stress Prediction

A Machine Learning + Streamlit web app that predicts the **stress levels of students** based on survey responses.  
This project uses a trained ML model to analyze patterns in student behavior, lifestyle, and academics to classify stress levels.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student_stress_prediction.git
   cd student_stress_prediction
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Then open the link in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501/`).

## 📊 Dataset

* **StressLevelDataset.csv** → Contains survey responses about student lifestyle, academics, and stress indicators.
* **questions.txt** → Survey questions used to collect responses.
* **top\_10\_mental\_health\_hospitals\_india.csv** → Extra dataset listing hospitals/resources in India.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

* The training pipeline is inside `traning.ipynb`.
* The model is trained using classical ML techniques (check the notebook for details).
* Saved model: `model.pkl`
* Preprocessing scaler: `scaler.pkl`

---

## 🌟 Features

* Predicts **stress levels** based on student survey inputs.
* Interactive **Streamlit UI**.
* Includes dataset + notebook for transparency.
* Provides **mental health resources** (top hospitals in India).

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add deep learning models for higher accuracy.
* Deploy on ** Heroku / AWS**.
* Expand dataset for better generalization.

Want me to also cook up a **short version** (like a 10-line minimal README) that you can use if you prefer a lightweight one instead of this detailed doc?
